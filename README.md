Gallery Recipe
==============

The Gallery Recipe enables you to build image galleries by creating content 
items of type "Gallery".

This module is still in an experimental state and not ready for production.


Requirements
------------

- [Colorbox](https://github.com/backdrop-contrib/colorbox)
- [HTML5 Upload](https://github.com/backdrop-contrib/html5_upload)

If you install the recipe with the Project browser, Backdrop will install 
the required modules as well.

In case you already use Colorbox: The recipe will change its 'Style' from 
"Default" to "Plain (mainly for images)". You can adjust the style in the 
Colorbox settings (Configuration > Media > Colorbox).


Installation
------------

Install and enable this module using the official Backdrop CMS instructions at 
https://docs.backdropcms.org/documentation/extend-with-modules.
  
Disabling and uninstalling this module will not delete the configuration that 
the recipe provides. If you no longer wish to keep the recipes functionality, 
you will need to remove it manually.


Documentation
-------------

Before you start, go to the content type configuration (Structure > Content 
types > Gallery), have a look at the Permissions and adjust them if necessary.

To build an image gallery, create a Gallery content item (Content > Add 
content > Gallery), add a Title and some Images, and save the item.
